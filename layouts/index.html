    <p>Hi, my name is Kush (she/her) and I’m a Cebu-based independent filmmaker and video editor. I’m currently working as a video editor at a Singapore-based 
      <a href="https://fewstones.com/">video production company</a>. I create and write short films and collaborate 
      with fellow artists. My thesis film has been exhibited at independent film festivals in the Philippines. I make <a href="https://krabf.gumroad.com/">Notion templates</a>, explore technology, publish thoughts. 
      I also happen to love brewing coffee at home and my reviews can be found <a href="coffee.krabf.com/">here</a>.</p>
