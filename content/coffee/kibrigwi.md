+++

There is a sweet base here followed by a little bit of raisin notes for me, and the sweetness lingers, leaving a pleasant aftertaste that continues to delight the senses. Towards room temperature, the acidity in the cup feels like it's getting a bit lighter than it was on my first sip. It's as if I'm slowly tasting the subtle changes in flavor and complexity as the liquid warms up in my hand. The Kibrigiwi Thunguri AA is balanced really well between sugary sweetness and brighter acidity and that makes it an easy-drinking coffee.

SL stands for Scott Laboratories, which is the name of the Kenyan research centre that first developed these varieties in the 1930s. While World Coffee Research recognises three “official” SL varieties (and there are supposedly many more), SL-28 and SL-34 are the most popular in specialty coffee.

While both varieties can be found outside the country in small concentrations (SL-28 has spread to parts of Latin America, for instance), they are most common by far in Kenya. As such, they are now almost synonymous with Kenyan specialty coffee production.
